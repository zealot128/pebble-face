My personal watch face for Pebble 2 only;

* Simple Analog watch
* German weather/date formatting and SI units
* Wind rose with wind speed (in km/h, nice for biking), humidity in top right corner
* Switches to light theme on datetime (~30 min after sunrise) and dark theme after sunset (~30min later)
* In addition to analogue watchface, the digital time is also displayed on the watch in a free area


## Ideas for later, if pebble Rocky.js has more functionality:

* Do something on shake
* Battery life alert for phone's or watch's battery
* Health info, like Heart Rate or steps
* Different displayed information on on day and night
* Icons for weather instead of Text
